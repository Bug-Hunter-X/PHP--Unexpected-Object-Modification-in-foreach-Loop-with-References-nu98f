To avoid this error, avoid using references inside the foreach loop unless absolutely necessary and you understand the implications.
Instead, iterate over the array by value and create copies or clone objects within the loop:

```php
function modifyObjects(array $objects) {
    foreach ($objects as $object) {
        $newObject = clone $object; // Create a copy
        $newObject->value++;
        //Further work with $newObject
    }
    return $objects;//return the original array if needed
}

$objects = [
    (object)['value' => 1],
    (object)['value' => 2],
];

modifyObjects($objects);
print_r($objects); // Output: Correct, values incremented once.
```

Alternatively, if you must modify the original objects directly (e.g., you're working with a large array and want to avoid object copying), reset the reference within the loop after each modification:

```php
function modifyObjects(array &$objects) {
    foreach ($objects as $key => &$object) {
        $object->value++;
        unset($objects[$key]); //breaks the reference
        $objects[$key] = $object; //resets the reference
    }
}
```
By understanding the nuances of references in PHP, developers can write more robust and predictable code.
